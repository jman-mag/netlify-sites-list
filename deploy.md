# Deploy to Netlify

Since the Netlify CLI is having issues, here are the steps to deploy this site:

## Option 1: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
4. Select the repository: `jman-mag/netlify-sites-list`
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `/` (root)
6. Click "Deploy site"

## Option 2: Manual Upload

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "New site from Git" → "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the entire `netlify-sites-list` folder
4. Your site will be deployed automatically

## Option 3: Fix CLI and Deploy

If you want to fix the CLI issues:

```bash
# Update to latest version
npm install -g netlify-cli@latest

# Or try a specific version
npm install -g netlify-cli@15.0.0

# Then try linking again
netlify link
netlify deploy --prod --dir .
```

## Site Features

Once deployed, your site will have:
- ✅ All 52 Netlify sites listed
- ✅ Search and filter functionality
- ✅ Statistics dashboard
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Direct links to repositories
- ✅ Last updated timestamps

## Custom Domain (Optional)
